# Monet-CycleGAN
This project explores generating "Monet Style" images from photos implementing Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Network (CycleGAN). At the time of writing, this project is an assignment for "DTSA 5511: Introduction to Deep Learning". This is my first time implementing CycleGAN or working with TensorFlow Record (tfrec) files so I relied upon many sources and tutorials to complete this project. The main difference between this model from source documentation and tutorials is additional jittering steps and the implementation of an efficient neural network (ENet) as opposed to UNet or Resnet to construct the generator. I have included a comprehensive list of sources in the project notebook.
